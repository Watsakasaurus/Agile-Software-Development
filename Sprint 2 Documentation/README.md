William & Andrius - Working together and have managed to get the map API to work properly with the database and return coordinates properly. They are now trying to implement a summary of each medical centre to attach to the correct points on the map.
Alek - Researched the WUHCAG guidelines for accessibility, planning to create a list of features whihc need to be implemented for compliance up to level AAA.
